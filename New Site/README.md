=====================

README.md

=====================

This is the website for Claremorris CoderDojo (claremorrisdojo.com).

Just some rules:

1. Don't edit this file without permission.

2. When you're editing files, use the TAB KEY. NO SPACES! It's a pain in the ass to change it to correct whitespace.

3. This is for the website code/markup, not the content. Just use filler text (i.e. Lorem Ipsum etc.).

4. When writing any content, don't start a paragraph with a "p" tag; start it as if you were writing a text file: with a tab. To do a tab, use "&emsp ". REMEMBER: use a space at the end, as shown.

...thanks!
